# My Personal Portfolio -
Welcome to my portfolio repo, I've currently been doing web development for 3 months now, and have decided to finally make an actual portfolio and with it being hosted via GitHub pages. I really appreciate any tips and suggestions regarding this project on how to improve it, I do have an open mind to criticism.

# Why Make A Portfolio ?
I decided to make this repo as a means to prove evidence to myself and what I do to my future employers, and constantly maintaining + updating this as my technologies evolve and as I progress further into web development and software development
